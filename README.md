# Car_Classification
A comparison of feature extraction methods and difference machine learning models on car classification. We use PCA for feature extraction and different supervised learning algorithms - Naive Bayes, SVM, Logistic Regression & Random Forest, for classification. Our objective is to compare which feature extraction techniques and algorithms would aid in building an accurate classification model.
